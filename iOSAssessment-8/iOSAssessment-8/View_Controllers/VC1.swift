        Frame -> A frame is Location and Size of a View which uses the Coordinate System of parent's View.

        Bound -> A Bound is Location and Size of a View which uses it's Own Coordinate System.

        clipsToBounds : with clipsToBounds set to YES, I'll only see the part of the subview that fits within the bounds of the superview. Otherwise, if clipsToBounds is set to NO, I'll see the entire subview, even the parts outside the superview
         

        masksToBounds: If the masksToBounds property is set to YES, any sublayers of the layer that extend outside its boundaries will be clipped to those boundaries.
            When masksToBounds is NO, no clipping occurs, and any sublayers that extend outside the layer's boundaries will be visible in their entirety.

           ---/// masksToBounds view Ke Layer Par Use Karte Hai///

         A strong reference : is like creating a new root for the tree, increasing it’s retain count by 1 and further ensuring it won’t be destroyed.

         A weak reference : is like observing the tree from afar. You can still perform all the same functions on it, but have no control over keeping it rooted and thereby ensuring it is not destroyed. If all its strong references are removed, you won’t be able to access the object.
