//Task 5: Explore about Segue and create a short note on its use.

/*  Segues are visual connectors between view controllers in your storyboards, shown as lines between the two controllers. They allow you to present one view controller from another.
 
 */




//Task 6: Explore diff between Xib's And ViewController and create a short note on its difference.


/*
 ---StoryBoard--
 
 We use StoryBordID and register Its Class Name in Identity Inspector
 
 1-In Storyboard we can also use XIB if we need it in Storyboard.
 2-Storyboard contains all the controllers, like tool bar, view controller, ant tab bar.
 3-Storyboard is good for seeing how the controllers connect to each other.

 ---XIB----
 
 we used to register our XIB through NIB.
 
 1-In XIB there is no flow of control and transition between the view and controller.
 2-In XIB modularity is done in a very nice way.
 3-It contains item like buttons, text fields, labels.
 4-In XIB it gives you more flexibility, and simplicity in terms of code.
