//---------------------------------What is URLSession?---------------------


URLSession is the class responsible for making HTTP request and getting HTTP response. In Layman terms,think of URLSession as a web browser and it can have multiple tabs opening multiple website. Those tabs which request and load website data are URLSessionTask. One URLSession can have multiple URLSessionTask send request to different website.


We can create a instance of URLSession like this :

let config = URLSessionConfiguration.default
let session = URLSession(configuration: config)




//---------------------------What are types of URLSessionConfiguration?----------------

URLSession instance is initialized using URLSessionConfiguration.
URLSessionConfiguration has three types :

1--> .default - The URLSession will save cache / cookie into disk, credentials are saved to keychain

2--> .ephemeral - This is similar to opening Incognito mode on Chrome or Private browsing on Firefox / Safari, cache / cookie / credential are stored in memory and will be gone once the session is terminated

3--> .background - This allow the session to perform upload / download task in the background, meaning even if the app is suspended (in background), the upload / download task will still continue.
